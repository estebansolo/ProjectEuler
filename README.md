# #ProjectEuler100

In this repository I will document my progress while solving the first 100 problems of the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives).

This is a challenge inspired by this [post](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/projecteuler100-coding-challenge-competitive-programming/) from [Quincy Larson](https://twitter.com/ossia).

### It is recommended that you do look at other people's solutions for problems that you haven't solved".
